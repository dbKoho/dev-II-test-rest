# Interview Exercise

We want you to read over the public Pokemon API endpoints and create two pages:

1. A list of all the available pokemon types

- Be able to select a pokemon type from a list
- When a pokemon type is selected, it would display the list of pokemon of that type
- Clicking on the pokemon name, it would go to a new page that would display some details about that pokemon

2. A Pokemon detail page. This page would display:

- The name of the pokemon
- A data grid of stat name (`stat.name`) and its respective base stat (`base_stat`)

You are able to use the GraphQL or REST API
